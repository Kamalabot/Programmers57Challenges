# 57 Programmers Challenges  

Being a hacker starts by simply taking one problem and solving it. 57 Programmers challenges is a book by Brian Hogan, aimed squarely at 
making the reader a good coder and a programmer. There are countless algorithms, data structures, and reciepes to solve the problems. If 
you can solve them with your own style, then the confidence it provides is very high. 

The book does provide confidence copiously. Like a videogame where the problems are made simple so you get addicted to the game, the book gets 
you addicted to solving problems with any programming language you love. Whether it is using simple command line interface, using GUI or APIs
every aspect of the challenge is put forward in the appropriate exercises. 

# Coding is Skill that needs to be sharpened
Coding is a skill that develops by programming in real world. The challenges are created to match with the real world requirements. 
Since the book is language agnostic, it can be used with any programming language. I have used Python after I completed the Learn Python the 
Hard Way by Zed Shaw.
